Description: Sparse estimation for Cox PH models is done via
    Minimum approximated Information Criterion (MIC) by Su, Wijayasinghe, 
    Fan, and Zhang (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12484>. MIC mimics the best 
    subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet with no need 
    of a tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with a 
    re-parameterization step so that it reduces to one unconstrained non-convex
    yet smooth programming problem, which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore,
    the re-parameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of
    circumventing post-selection inference.
